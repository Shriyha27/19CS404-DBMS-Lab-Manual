# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.

### Entities and Attributes

| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK)| Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
|Members |type,name,date      |       |
|Trainers|name,specifications |       |
|Attendance|session,date,status|      |
|Programs|Program_name        |       |
|Payment |date,amount,method  |       |
|Training|duration,time       |       |
 session                      |       |

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship     | Entities Involved             | Cardinality (Min-Max)|
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Choose**       | Members ↔ Training Session    | Many-to-Many (M\:N)  |
| **Register**     | Members ↔ Programs            | Many-to-Many (M\:N)  |
| **Assigned\_to** | Trainers ↔ Programs           | Many-to-Many (M\:N)  |
| **Records**      | Attendance ↔ Training Session | Many-to-Many (M\:N)  |
| **Makes**        | Members ↔ Payment             | One-to-Many (1\:M)   |


### Assumptions
```
Members: Each member can choose multiple training sessions (M:N relationship with Choose).
Training Sessions: Each session can have multiple members and multiple trainers.
Trainers: A trainer can be assigned to multiple training sessions (Assigned_to).
Programs: Each program can have multiple sessions, and members can register for multiple programs (Register).
Attendance: Attendance is recorded per session for each member, including status and date.
Payment: Each member can make multiple payments, linked to programs or sessions (Makes).
